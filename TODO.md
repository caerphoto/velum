# To Do

* a way to keep track of article files - build on startup, restart to rebuild?

* converting markdown pages to html

* template system to insert partials into main page templates

* partials:
    - article previews
    - article content
    - header/footer

* main page template types:
    - front page: big header
    - search results (including tags): like non-first index, but with sorting options
    - non-first index pages: smaller header
    - tag list page
